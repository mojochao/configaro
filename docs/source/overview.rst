Overview
========

What is it?
-----------

``configaro`` is a Python configuration library that's music to your ears..

Why should I care?
------------------

``configaro`` has been created with the following design goals in mind:

- provide a system with a simple API that is easy to use and gets out of your way
- provide a system that allows for hierarchical configuration data that supports dot-addressable property access
- provide a system that allows for configuration defaults and local overrides
- provide a system with complete test coverage
- provide a system with complete documentation

If this sounds appealing to you, keep on reading.

What about Python 2?
--------------------

I have zero interest in supporting Python 2 at this point.  If you are still
using Python 2 then move along -- there's nothing to see here.  Fork this repo
if you like and submit a pull request.
